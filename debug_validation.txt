  "is_correct": true,
  "explanation": "The student's answer is correct. When using the chain rule to differentiate (x - 2)^2, you first take the derivative of the outer function, which is 2 times the inner function (x - 2), and then multiply by the derivative of the inner function, which is 1. The student's answer, 2(x-2), is mathematically equivalent to the expected answer, as multiplying by 1 does not change the value.",
  "user_answer": "2(x-2)",
  "correct_answer": "The derivative is $\\frac{d}{dx}(x - 2)^2 = 2(x - 2)$.",
  "step_question": "What is the derivative of $(x - 2)^2$ using the chain rule?"
